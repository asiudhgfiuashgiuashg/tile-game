Currently in game:
Character movement(arrows and wasd)
Walking animations(up, down left and right)
	animations are generated through a method using a spritesheet when given the row number and length of frames
Boundries(Character can't move beyond the visible screen)
Basic scrolling map, using black and white tiles



Known Problems:
Walking animations pauses in the middle once the key is let go
After moving the movement methods into the map class, 
	pressing several arrow keys at the same times causes it to choose one of them and move in that direction


Things to add:
More tiles
Movement between maps
Collisions
items
NPC's
Enemies
