Updated: 3/16/15 - The Prophesied Day of Item Drawing Completion

Currently in game:
Character movement(arrows and wasd)

Walking animations(up, down left and right)
	animations are generated through a method using a spritesheet when given the row number and length of frames

Basic scrolling map, using black and white tiles

Tile collision, includes outer map boundries

Basic item info and placement



Known Problems:
Walking animations pauses in the middle once the key is let go

moving alongside the very edge of a tile causes the player to check for collision adjacent to the tile, rather than where the player is moving

As the character moves, items on the screen seem to lag behind a bit, causing them to shift position slighty



Features to add:
More tiles
Movement between maps
interacting with items
objects
NPC's
Enemies


Things to do:
